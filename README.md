# Query Complexity of Mastermind Variants
We study variants of [Mastermind](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mastermind_(board_game)), a popular board game in which the objective is sequence reconstruction. In this two-player game, the so-called *codemaker* constructs a hidden sequence $H = (h_1, h_2, ..., h_n)$ of colors selected from an alphabet $latex A = {1, 2, ..., k}$ (*i.e.,* $latex h_i\in A$ for all $latex i\in\{1,2,\ldots, n\}$). The game then proceeds in turns, each of which consists of two parts: in turn $latex t$, the second player (the \textit{codebreaker}) first submits a query sequence $latex Q_t = (q_1, q_2, \ldots, q_n)$ with $latex q_i\in \mathcal{A}$ for all $latex i$, and second receives feedback $latex \Delta(Q_t, H)$, where $latex \Delta$ is some agreed-upon function of distance between two sequences with $latex n$ components. The game terminates when $latex Q_t = H$, and the codebreaker seeks to end the game in as few turns as possible. Throughout we let $latex f(n,k)$ denote the smallest integer such that the codebreaker can determine any $latex H$ in $latex f(n,k)$ turns. We prove three main results: First, when $latex H$ is known to be a permutation of $latex \{1,2,\ldots, n\}$, we prove that $latex f(n, n)\ge n - \log\log n$ for all sufficiently large $latex n$. Second, we show that Knuth's Minimax algorithm identifies any $latex H$ in at most $latex nk$ queries. Third, when feedback is not received until all queries have been submitted, we show that $latex f(n,k)=\Omega(n\log k)$.
